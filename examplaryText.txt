While the relative majority of the people in Albania are of Muslim background,
there are also large minorities of people with Christian (either Orthodox or Catholic) backgrounds.
Many Albanians, regardless of their background may be agnostic, and religious observance as a whole is relaxed
(recent polling shows that only 30 to 40 percent are observant).
Marriages between people of different religious backgrounds are very common and in some places, even the rule.
Traditional Albanian culture honors the role and person of the guest.
In return for this place of honor, respect is expected from the guest.
Albanians enjoy the long walks in the city streets, drinking coffee, and among the younger generations, participating in nightlife activities such as cafe lounging and dancing.
