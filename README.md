typingMonitor
=============

Tiny Python script to register the speed and accuracy with which you type.

My very first Python script. It presents a number of sentences it reads from a text file, one by one. After having copied all sentences a number of errors are signaled and typing speed is provided.

Note that running this script requires a Python 3 interpreter.
The text that is used can be replaced by copy pasting alternative text in the textfile, or by changing the link inside the script.
